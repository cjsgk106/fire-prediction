## Fire Prediction
This project is about an analysis of fire hazard in buildings using data about fire and buildings in Kimhae, South Korea.
And a predictive model was developed after data wrangling and preprocessing.

## Motivation
It was a Kaggle-like competition held by Korea Land and Housing Corporation.
As the number of fire outbreaks increases and thus it produces loss of lives, this topic appealed to us to conduct an analysis in order to prevent such damage.
